# Benjamin Nhan
I am a 3rd year transfer pursuing a Bachelor's in ***Computer Science***.
I've been learning code since high school and have experienced too many _long sessions of 1 minor errors_.

My favorite line of code is 
```
git push
```
because that means I've completed something

### Outside of programming, I often:
- Play volleyball
- Find foodie spots
- Play video games
- Cook

>For volleyball, I'm an outside and have been playing since forever

>I like to try new things so I always eat something new especially if I go to a place often

>As for video games, I play both PC and Nintendo like Pokemon

>I can cook steak and fried rice but I can't do anything else 

For the future, some things I want
- [ ] seafood farm
- [ ] stable job 
- [ ] traveled all of Asia
- [ ] have clean skin
- [ ] have my own espresso machine
